## My process

### Built with

- Github Desktop
- VS Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this modern design, I was able to practice breaking down a design visually into html components first, then styling them one by one. By doing so, I was able to really take in what makes a good design through subtle details such as the subtle box shadow under the card.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - W3schools is where I learned the foundations of html and css, and I always go back when I need to refresh my memory on something.
